	'Trades About To Happen begins with a model of where trades most frequently appear on charts of all time periods. These trades occur around the edges of trading ranges and are described in subsequent chapters dealing separately with springs, upthrusts and absorption. They are the action signals of the Wyckoff method. Numerous examples of these key types of behavior are included.

	The use of lines is emphasized to show the trader how to understand larger structures on charts. Bar-by-bar chart studies are presented in the chapter entitled The Logic of Reading Bar Charts. It undoubtedly will be considered one of the most important discussions in the book.

	Two chapters explain the workings of the Weis Wave indicator and its evolution from Wyckoff’s original tape reading charts. Nowhere else can one find such detailed information on the Weis Wave. The final chapter includes a discussion of point & figure and renko charting. Wave volume is incorporated into both to give them added usefulness.

	For the trader interested in a succinct, modern treatment of Wyckoff’s methods, Trades About To Happen is a must read.'

	'The key element that has long separated tremendously successful traders from all others is their intuitive understanding that time regulates all financial opportunities. In 1984, J. Peter Steidlmayer formally introduced the Market Profile as a way to graphically depict the acceptance or rejection of price over time. For the first time, what had once been the domain of the intuitve trader was not accessible to all traders.

	The ability to record price information according to time has unleashed huge amounts of useful market information in a form never before available In turn, this information explosion has triggered a new way of looking at markets and opened the doors for accelerated levels of market analysis.

	Mind Over Markets is a book about learning; learning the dynamics of markets through the organization of price, time and volume, and learning how to synthesize this information with your own intuition.'

Unpredictably, and without his willing it, Monroe found himself leaving his physical body to travel via a "second body" to locales far removed from the physical and spiritual realities of his life. He was inhabiting a place unbound by time or death.

	Monroe recorded these experiences in two bestselling, landmark books, Journeys Out of the Body and Far Journeys. Ultimate Journey, his final and career-defining work, takes us further than we thought possible—and reveals to us what it all means.

	Ultimate Journey charts that area which lies "over the edge," beyond the limits of the physical world. It presents us with a map of the "interstate"—the route that opens to us when we leave our physical lives, with their entry and exit ramps, their singposts and their hazards. It also tells us how Monroe found the route and travelled it, and uncovered the reason and the purpose of this pioneering expedition. It is a journey that reveals basic truths about the meaning and purpose of life—and of what lies beyond.'

Even in its more restricted sense it covers a wide range of phenomena, differing so greatly in character that it is not easy to give a definition of the word which shall be at once succinct and accurate. It has been called "spiritual vision," but no rendering could well be more misleading than that, for in the vast majority of cases there is no faculty connected with it which has the slightest claim to be honoured by so lofty a name.'
